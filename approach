1- create a vite project in the client directory
2- initilize tailwind css
3- make a basic layout of the section 
4- Smart Contact 
    1- we use hard hat to tun solidity locallly and test the smart contacrt
    2- install hardhat--- npm install --save-dev hardhat
    3- use the commmand npx hardhat to start the sset up
    4- set up a normal project as for the current req 
    5- test weather the scripsta re able to comiple, if issue sced update teh npm modules from in program files 
    6- Make a New sol file name it transaction.sol 
    7-Contract is like class in js and other programing langusage
    8- uint is like int 
    9- events means functions
    10- hre.ethers.getContractFactory("Transactions"); genrates instances of the tranasactions
    11- To test we need to get test eth so go to the following website https://faucet.egorfine.com/
       - 1. To get the eth to test  first setup the metamask
         2.  meta mask chrome ext add it (I like the website);
         3. Now after making the account click on the profile icons and click on show hide test network 
         4. enable the show hide test in setting 
         5- select ropsson test network but sometimes no ropset is avalaible so to to coinlik fauset you will get 0.1 eth to test
    12- Alchemy is used to deploy our blockchain smart Contract create a new app and copy the http key for that app
    13- Go to hardhat config and del all and start with the the below
        require('@nomiclabs/hardhat-waffle'); 

        module.exports={
        solidity: '0.8.0',
        networks: {
            rinkeby:{
            url:"https://eth-rinkeby.alchemyapi.io/v2/ddedgdghfdhajfhhedfJ",
            accounts:['fdhfdhfhhjsfhajhajfhjahdjashd']
            }
        }
        }
        rinkeby is the object which store the url to our wallet and teh account private key
    14-npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network rinkeby   run the following commnad
    15- and on successful compilation you will receive a address which will be the contact address
    16- now files will be genrated  in artifacts an abi will be created a contract application binary interface its a 
        staandard way to interact with the contact from outside as well as from contract to contract

    17- store the now json files in artifacts call transaction in the clint side too because we are needed to 
        link sc with the fron end i.e client 
    
5- Now use a context api to route and do the linking so make a contex folder in the src
     1- create a file called transactionContext.jsx in the new folder
     2-
